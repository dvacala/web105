            <p id="indent">I am currently an Account Receivable Specialist at CDW. It has always been a place I have wanted to work. 
                I have seen many different articles about what an amazing place it is to work. The enviornment is very
                warm and welcoming. All the coworkers are kind, encouraging and always willing to help. There is so much
                support here from all my coworkers and Managers especially with how difficult it could be working full time, 
                going to school full time, and be a full time Mom. 
            </p>
            <p id="indent">Prior to working at CDW, I have had many different positons at Best Buy. When I first started out, I wanted
                to expand my expierence with technology and I joined the Home Theater department. I did not know much and 
                wanted to gain a better well rounded knowlegebase as well as excercising my communication skills. I have 
                moved up and around a lot in my Best Buy career. After I had left the Home Theater department, I worked 
                in the Computers, Mobile as the Verizon Expert, and then I had the amazing opportunity to expand my skills
                with Magnolia Design Center. 
            </p>
            <p id="indent">I was a System Designer for Magnolia and developed my communication skills as well as high end audio and video.
                I was approached by management during my successful career at Magnolia for a promotion to Sales Supervisor. From
                there I continued to excercise my areas of opportunities and reach my goals. Before leaving Best Buy, I had taken 
                a lateral move to Back Office Lead where I was the store's administrator. I was able to build on my office skills 
                before moving on to CDW.  
            </p>
            <p id="indent">I have a tendency to be a workaholic, but I do take time for myself and my family. Family is very important to me 
                especially when my daughter came along. She is five years old and gets bigger every morning! We love to go on adventures 
                together. Some of our favorite places include Brookfield Zoo and the museums in Chicago. Discovering and learning about 
                a wide variety of subjects is our favorite part. Another one of my favorite activites is going to Downtown Chicago. The Chicago Theater and the surrounding area is one of 
                my favorite spots. I have a wide taste in shows and performances and the Chicago Theater puts on many different kinds.
                I have seen some of my favorite comedians perform here, musical artists, as well as musicals. 
            </p>
            <p id="indent">I have a tendency to be a workaholic, but I do take time for myself and my family. Family is very important to me 
                I have a very colorful and well rounded background of my expierences and well as my own personal hobbies and intersts. I am a very 
                curious person who loves to learn. It is that kind of curiosity that got me so very interested in technology and how it all works, the hardware and software side. 
                It has always been a dream of mine to work at Google or Apple and be part of making the world a different and more exciting place than it was 
                yesterday. As Gandhi had said, <q>Be the change you want to see in the world.</q> and that is what I will strive to do.
