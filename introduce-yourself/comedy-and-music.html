            <h3>Comedy</h3>
            <p>I highly enjoy comedy shows and anything that is humerous. I love to go
                to comedy clubs and specials. One of my absolute favorite shows I have been
                to is Tom Segura. I went with my best friend with last minute tickets and it
                was a blast!

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Music is very important to me. It is how I am able to excape from reality.
                Music has always been something I turn to when I need to think or when I just
                want to feel good. I also love using it as background noise. Most of the time I
                don't even notice it, but I always notice when it is not on.
