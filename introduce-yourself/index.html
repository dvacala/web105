        <p>Hello! My name is Dominique. I am currently a full time mom, student, and employee.
            I am currently going to school to receive my Bachelor's in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>Technology has always been an area in my life that I have heavily enjoyed.
            Ever since I was little, it always came easy too me. My curiosity and creativity
            always lead me to want to learn more.</p>
