            <h3>Activites with my Daughter</h3>
            <p>I love to do many different fun activites with my daughter. We get
                a subscription box from KiwiCo. It is a different activity kit every
                month wrapped around the STEAM system. One of the most recent ones we did was about the human body. We
                made a steathscope, crafted some organs like the heart, stomach, and brain. We also
                played check up with a "patient".

            <h3>All Having Fun Together</h3>
            <p>Family is very important to me. Spending time together is the best way to celebrate
                family. Every holiday, my brothers and I go and visit my parents. We all play board games together,
                eat great food, and talk for hours catching up. My daughter and boyfriend love to come with to
                my parents for holidays. We all have a lot of fun.
