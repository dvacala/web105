                                    <dd>The library is where you draw your cards. They remain facedown. If you do not have any cards in your library and you

                                        game, you draw seven cards. This makes up your starting hand. At the end of your turn, if you have more than seven cards, 
                                        you must discard down to have only seven cards maximum. The discard card(s) go into your graveyard.

                                        Instants and soceries are never on the battlefield. The battlefield can be arranged to each player's personal preference. It is usually 
                                        best to keep your lands/mana at the bottom of the battlefield and group your other cards by type.

                                    <dd>The graveyard is your discard pile. When a creature dies, enchantment or artifact are destroyed they go into the graveyard.
                                        Once you cast an instant or sorcery, they also are discarded and are put into the graveyard.

                                    <dd>When playing commander format, the commander of the deck gets placed in the command zone at the beginning of the game. 
                                        if this creature were to die, be exiled, or returned to your hand you may chose to place them back in the command zone.
                                        Each time they re-enter the command zone, there is a commander tax of two mana for each time they have been casted previously.

                                    <dd>To tap a card means to turn it on its side. This shows when a card has been used for the turn. Whenever you use lands to create mana, 
                                        the lands become tapped. Whenever a creature attacks, the creature becomes tapped as well. Some activated abilities will also specify if they
                                        need to be tapped in order to activate the ability. Permanets cannot become untapped unless it is during your untap step.

                                    <dd>In order to cast spells, you must pay the mana cost. The mana cost is in the top right hand corner of the card. Lands are used as specific mana. 
                                        Each land has a symbol for black, red, blue, green, and white. You must use the correct corresponding colors to cast the spells. When a card does not
                                        show a mana symbol and instead shows a number, this means you can tap any color of mana for that cost. These are known as colorless mana costs.

                                        If damage is dealt to an opponent, they lose that much life.
