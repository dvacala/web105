        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Magic the Gathering is a card game which is played by two or more players who engage in a battle acting as wizards
            called planeswalkers. Each player has their own deck which they have made or have purchased preconstructed. These decks
        follow the rules of the format in which they're being played. A few of the most popular formats include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard</li>
            <li>Commander</li>
            <li>Booster Draft</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will be focusing on the Commander format. Within this format, each deck is made up of 100 cards. Commander is about chosing a legandary
             creature that will serve as your commander and the rest of your deck is built around them and their color identity.In Commander, each player
            starts out with 40 life instead of 20. The video below runs through a quick explanation about the basics.</p>

                <h3>Color Types</h3>
                <p>There are five different color types. Each card can be a mono color or multi color. To cast creatures and spells, you must pay mana
                    of the card's colors. These colors consist of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red</li>
                    <li>Blue</li>
                    <li>Black</li>
                    <li>White</li>
                    <li>Green</li>
                </ul>    
            </div>
            <div class="flex-column">
                <h3>Text Box</h3>
                <p>In the text box of cards, some cards have special abilites. These abilities can be a caracteristic an object has, something that changes
                    how the game affects that player or opponents, and/or can be activated/triggered. Abilites can be beneficial or detrimental.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex-column">
                <h3>Power/Toughness</h3>
                <p>On each creature card, there is a power and toughness that is displayed (Example: 2/2). The first number is the creature's 
                    power. This represents the amount of damange it can deal during combat. The second number is the toughness. This is the amount of damange
                    that needs to be dealt to it in a single turn to destroy it.
                </p>

                <h3>Card Types</h3>
                <p> There are different card types as well. Each card type is used in different ways to play the game. These cards consist of: </p>
                <dl>
                    <li>Creatures</li>
                    <dd>These are permanent cards. They serve the player, usually by fighting on their
                        behalf.
                    </dd>
                    <li>Artifacts</li>
                    <dd>These are permanet cards. They represent magical items. </dd>
                    <li>Sorceries</li>
                    <dd>Represents one shot spells. They are not permanets and are immediately put into the graveyard.</dd>
                    <li>Instants</li>
                    <dd>Like sorceries, they are one shot spells. They are not permanets. These however can be played at any time
                        even during another player's turn.</dd>
                    <li>Enchantments</li>
                    <dd>Represents magical effects and are permanets. They usually remain in play indefinitely. Most have continous
                        or triggered abilites.

                    <li>Lands</li>
                    <dd>Represents locations under player's control. Most of which generate mana to cast creatures and spells.</dd>
                    <li>Planeswalkers</li>
                    <dd>Within each game, players are considered Planeswakers. There are cards however that are also Planeswakers which can 
                        have abilities that are activated with loyalty counters.
