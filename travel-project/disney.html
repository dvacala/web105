            <h2>A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes</h2>
            <p>Disney World is a magical place. There is no doubt about it. There isn't a single generation that didn't
                grow up
                with Disney in their childhood. This place definately brings out your inner kid especially with the four
                parks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Magic Kingdom
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cinderella Castle</li>
                        <li>Space Mountain</li>
                        <li>Haunted Mansion</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Animal Kingdom
                    <ul>
                        <li>World of Avatar</li>
                        <li>DinoLand</li>
                        <li>Lion King</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Epcot
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finding Nemo</li>
                        <li>Frozen</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Disney's Hollywood Studios
                    <ul>
                        <li>Star Wars</li>
                        <li>Toy Story</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Disney World can make anyone a kid again. It is where everyone's childhood comes to life from classic
                rides like "It's a Small World" to Star Wars.
                This wonderful place brings the old favorites with the new into one great adventure. You can be
                traveling along with Jack Sparrow across the Seven
                Seas to flying fast through Space Mountain. Everyone can meet their favorite characters as well as join
                them in epic adventures. One thing that Disney
                World stands out the most is with their fantastic night shows and parades. Everyday at Disney is a
                celebration.

                <h3>Dominique's Opinion</h3>
                <p>Growing up, my generation when through what was known as the Disney Renaissance. This is the time
                    period where Disney really took off and came out with
                    hit movies such as The Little Mermaid, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and so many more. Disney
                    will always have a place in my heart as it was a big part
                    of my childhood as well as it being part of my daughter's. One of the best things about being a
                    parent is sharing your expierences as a kid with your own.
                    Disney World is definately the place to do just that. These parks do an amazing job at mixing the
                    classics with the latest hits. You really can't ask for
                    a more personal expierence between parent and child.
                </p>
                <h3>Kid at Heart</h3>
                <p>The true magic behind Disney World is the fact that it teleports you back in time. That is what it
                    did for me. Growing up I had gone to Disney a few times.
                    It wasn't the best place to visit multiple growing up. Disney World is an expierence I believe
                    everyone who holds Disney close to should have. It is amazing
                    and fun in every way possible. It is however something that may not be enjoyable the second time
                    around in a short time span for those of all ages. These parks
                    cater more towards younger kids. I had to opportunity to bring my daugher here and see the happiness
                    it had brought her. The most enjoyable time was spent
                    seeing how happy she was to soak it all in.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                Disney World is an adventure for parents who want to bring out their childhood spirit with their young
                ones. As the kid's are older, it may not be as enjoyable
                for them as the little ones. This destination is best made once or twice until the kids are teens.
                Disney has brought in a lot more attractions for the older kid
                crowd within the past few years though with the selling point to be on the expierence you enjoy, the
                second time around may not feel the same.
