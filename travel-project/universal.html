            <h2>The Many Different Choices...</h2>
            <p>At Universal Studios there are two main parks and have many different adventures within those parks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Universal Studios
                    <ul>
                        <li>Revenge of the Mummy</li>
                        <li>Transformers</li>
                        <li>Minions</li>
                        <li>Wizdaring World Diagon Alley</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Islands of Adventure
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marval Studios</li>
                        <li>Seuss Land</li>
                        <li>Jurassic Park</li>
                        <li>Wizarding World Hogsmeade</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <P>Universal Studios has the whole package for everyone who has always wanted to go to Hogwarts but never
                got a letter. Now is your chance. The two parks
                actually connect together through the Harry Potter World. You can take a ride on the Hogwarts Express to
                travel from Diagon Alley to Hogsmeade, go to
                Olivander's Wand Shop, and even drink butter beer after saving Gringots Bank.
            </P>
            <p>There are countless rides where you are part of your favorite movies' action! With Dr. Seuss Land, Marval
                Studios, and Jurassic Park there is something
                for everyone in the family at this destination. You will not be disappointed.
            </p>

                <h3>Dominique's Opinion:</h3>
                <p>I love movies. Ever since I was a little girl going to the movie theater has always been my favorite.
                    Watching the big screen and wishing
                    I could be part of the movie is every kids dream. I grew up and those dreams never went away. Harry
                    Potter movies have always been a big
                    part of my childhood and being able to expierence the Wizarding World was one of the best
                    expierences.
                    My brother and I got to actually be
                    part of the Olivander's Wand show together. We got custom picked wands just for us. The wands were
                    interactive too. You can actaully use them
                    around Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley to "cast spells". It was an amazing and fun expierence. Universal
                    did
                    an amazing job bringing the Wizarding
                    World to life.
                </p>
                <p>Not only is there the Wizarding World, but there is also Marval Studios and Jurassic Park. Marval
                    Studios
                    is very unique as it is based on the comics
                    more than the Marval movies and Tv shows. It is really cool to see the comic art all around. I love
                    big
                    roller coasters and riding the Incredible Hulk is
                    thrilling! Jurassic Park has a ride that takes you water rafting through a broken Rapter exhibit.
                    There
                    really is a ride for every one of my favorite movies.
                    I could list them all but it would be better expierence for you to enjoy it yourself.
                </p>
                <h3>Not Just for the Big Kids</h3>
                <p>One of the many things I hear is that Universal Studios does not cater towards young children. As it
                    is
                    true that Universal Studios does not have as many
                    younger kid rides as Disney World, they are definately not lacking them. I took my now five year old
                    daughter to Universal when she was three and she was
                    never bored. She had a thrilling time in Seuss Land as well as going on the Minions ride. The
                    expierence
                    itself was overwheling for her. She got to see many of
                    her favorite superheros, Shrek, and SpongeBob. Some of the rides she was unable to go on but just
                    intaking the world around her was entertainment enough.
                </p>
                <h3>My Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Universal is the place to go for the whole family that has a wide age range. There quite literally
                    something for everyone. I have been going to Universal since
                    I was five years old and it is somewhere I will always want to keep coming back to. The parks have
                    changed so much from when I was young but many are still around.
                    The fact that there is always something new every couple of years is great. This is a repeat vaction
                    destination for any family.
